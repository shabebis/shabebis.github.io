## Visuals Inspiration
I hope to also indicate my personality and interests via the visual theming of my website. To this end, it may be in my interest to incorporate black, gray, and near-white for the layout; this helps create a legible background and fair contrast (it will not overshadow my primary content).

Then I would like to contrast this with a bold color, such as red or green to indicate vitality. Furthermore, I hope to use interesting typography to grab the attention of my viewer.

## Visual Theme
### Theme Ideas
**"Punk" Theme**
I have chosen to incorporate a punk aesthetic into my website design to showcase my personality and creative mindset to potential UX/UI employers. By using cut-out letters of varying fonts and sizes, I aim to communicate authenticity, differentiate myself from the crowd, and demonstrate my ability to bring fresh perspectives and unique ideas to my design work. The punk aesthetic evokes a sense of energy and excitement, allowing me to create a memorable and visually striking website that captures the attention of employers. With a consistent color palette of gray, black, white, and neon green used as accents, I maintain a balance between professionalism and personal style, ensuring that my design choices remain sophisticated and impactful. By embracing this punk aesthetic, I can create an emotional connection with potential employers and leave a lasting impression, showcasing my ability to infuse personality and creativity into my designs while still delivering high-quality user experiences.

**Tech Theme**
Another theme idea for my UX design portfolio could revolve around a "Futuristic" or "Tech-Forward" concept. This theme allows me to showcase my expertise in designing for innovation, cutting-edge technologies, and forward-thinking user experiences. With a clean and minimalistic design approach, I aim to convey professionalism and sophistication while emphasizing user-centric design principles. By incorporating high-tech visuals, such as abstract shapes, geometric patterns, and futuristic illustrations, along with vibrant colors like electric pink, I can create a visually captivating portfolio that captures the essence of a futuristic and technologically advanced world. Through interactive and dynamic components, including scroll animations and micro-interactions, I can demonstrate my ability to engage users and create immersive experiences. By featuring case studies that involve emerging technologies such as virtual reality, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, or Internet of Things, I can highlight my expertise in designing for the future.

### Final Theme
I will be using my first-pitched theme, however will be trying to incorporate scroll animations and micro-interactions to increase the professionalism of my site. It may also enhance user engagement and create a dynamic user experience; I can bring movement and interactivity to my portfolio, making it visually engaging and captivating for potential employers. I hope to create a unique and modern fusion, reflecting my personality while demonstrating my ability to think creatively and push the boundaries of traditional design.

## Persona
Oscar Alvar is a middle-aged professional in the gaming industry. Specifically, he works as a hiring manager for an independent video game studio, in which he searches for possible interns that demonstrate interest and skill relevant to the gaming industry. Alvar has almost two decades in sponsoring and developing project-based teams under his belt.

Interns meeting his qualifications typically display knowledge of programming languages (ex: C++) or animation/modeling skills (creating sprites, textures, etc.). He conducts most of his research on a PC. He may spend as long as 2 minutes on a website when searching for interns.

## Layout & Composition
### Layout and Site Design

The homepage should briefly introduce my career interest and personality to potential employers. To this end, I hope to include a short paragraph describing my skills and design focus. An image to the right will show a candid profile picture to demonstrate my personality. As the user scrolls down, my past projects will appear.

### Refined Design - Persona Rationale
Alvar is hoping to identify a person that has produced enough content to qualify for a position at an internship at his video game studio. Demonstration of art skills, prior team projects within video game development, and familiarity with some programming are essential to game development execution.

Providing animations and art clearly lets Alvar know whether or not someone meets minimum design/art requirements. Content like music may prove itself to be a useful/bonus skill. Lastly, Oscar would benefit from gauging a person's ability to cooperate and collaborate with other thinkers.
